    <h1>To Rapha, My Angel</h1>
    <h2>A letter from my heart to yours</h2>
    <p>I will never forget the day we met for the first time. I remember it clearly, you laughed, and that smile, that simple, genuine smile, was the moment that changed everything for me. I was completely unaware of how much you would mean to me. From that moment I have never felt so certain of someone ever in my life. They say "when you know, you know" up until that moment I hadn't known at all, but with you I knew, I knew when I first laid eyes on you, when I saw you laugh. When I'm with you, I feel a sense of peace and happiness that I've never known before. It's as if all the pieces of my life fall perfectly into place, and I know, deep down, that this is where I'm supposed to be. Right here, with you. I can't explain it completely, but I think some things in life don't need explanations. Some things just feel right, like the way the sun rises each morning or the way the stars shine at night. That's how it feels being with you, natural, effortless, and so incredibly right.</p>
    <p>As time passed you only continued to prove me right, that you are, without a doubt, the most incredible person I've ever met. You have this incredible ability to light up a room just by walking into it. Your laughter is pure joy, and your kindness is something that the world needs more of. You have a way of making everyone around you feel special, and I'm constantly amazed by how effortlessly you do it.</p>
    <p>Every time I try to put into words what you mean to me, I feel like I'm reaching for something that's just beyond my grasp, because words always fall short. You're not only the most beautiful person I've ever known but also the most gentle, compassionate, and caring soul I've ever encountered. Every time you speak, there's a warmth and sincerity in your voice that instantly makes me feel at ease. You bring light to every room you enter, as if you carry your own sun, warming everyone around you. Your kindness isn't just a part of who you are, it defines you, and it's the most wonderful kind of beauty.</p>
    <p>You have a heart that's as big as the universe, always giving, always caring, and always looking out for others, you are so selfless. The way you show kindness and empathy to everyone around you is something truly special, and it's one of the many reasons I admire you so much.</p>
    <p>And then there's your sense of humour, how you can make me laugh even on the toughest days, how your laughter is so infectious that I can't help but join in (I'm still funnier tho). You have this way of turning the simplest moments into the best memories, and I cherish every single one of them.</p>
    <p>But what truly makes you amazing isn't just the way you brighten the world around you. It's your strength, your compassion and your intelligence. You have gone through a lot in the past, you faced challenges with such grace and courage, and you inspire me every day to be a better person. I am so proud of how far you came. I'm so proud of the person that you are today and the one youâ€™re becoming.</p>
    <p>Knowing you has opened my eyes to a world of goodness and hope, where even the smallest gestures feel like grand acts of love. You see the best in others, even when they can't see it themselves, and you give selflessly without ever expecting anything in return. Your smile is like a quiet sunrise, and when you look at me, I feel truly seen and understood. Being around you feels like being wrapped in something safe and timeless, like I've found a piece of home in you. You are everything lovely and true, and no matter how many words I use, they will always fall short of expressing just how deeply I cherish every part of you. It becomes clearer that you've touched my life in a way I never thought possible. I have run out of words to express my feelings for youâ€¦</p>
    <p>So Rapha, I want to love you, understand who you are, accept it and to love you nevertheless, I've held this in for so long, but I can't hide it anymore. I want you to know that I LOVE YOU RAPHA ANGEL. I promise to love you unconditionally. Please understand that you are worthy of love, and you are not hard to love. Loving you is the easiest thing in this world to do, it's almost as if I was made to love you. I know at times everything can seem overwhelming because of your past experiences. I know you might not be ready today or even tomorrow, but know I would wait a lifetime for you. I will choose you over and over again, I hope you will someday do the same. I love the way you make me feel, cherished, valued, and truly understood. I've come to realise that my feelings for you are not just fleeting emotions but a deep, enduring love that fills every corner of my heart. When I think of you, my world is brighter, my heart is lighter, and my heart is at peace. You've become an essential part of my life, and I can't imagine a future without you by my side. With you, I have found a love that is pure and true. A love that is patient, understanding, and endlessly giving. You make me want to be a better person, I don't want to do life with anyone else but you. And if loving you is a choice, then loving you is the best choice I ever made. So all I can hope is that someday you will open your heart and you will love me the way I love you.</p>
